0:  It's just, it's such a great privilege to exist that, that yeah, it's just, I think that's the scary part\nCluster 1: 0 so one of these were colored coins which is basically saying that hey let's not just use the blockchain for bitcoin but let's also like kind of issue other kinds of assets on it and then there was a protocol called master coin that supported issuing assets but also supported many other things like financial contracts like domain name registration and a lot of different things together and i spent some time working with these teams and i quickly kind of realized that this master coin protocol could be improved by kind of generalizing it more right so the best the analogy i use is that the master coin protocol was like this swiss army knife you have 25 different transaction types for 25 different applications but what i realized is that you could replace a bunch of them with things that are more general purpose so one of them was that you could replace like three transaction types for three types of financial contracts with a generic transaction type for a financial contract that just lets you specify a mathematical formula for kind of who how much money each side gets by the way it's a small pause what's you say financial contract just the terminology what is the contract what's a financial contract so this is just generally an agreement where kind of either one or two parties kind of put collateral kind of in and then they depending on kind of certain conditions like this could involve prices of assets this could involve the actions of the two parties it could involve other things but they kind of get different amounts of of assets out that just depend on things that happened so a contract is really a financial contract is at the core it's the it's the core interactive element of a financial system yeah there's yeah there's many different kinds of financial contracts like there's things like options where you kind of give someone the right to buy a thing that you have for some specific price for some period of time there's uh contracts for difference where you basically are kind of making a bet that says like for every dollar this thing goes up i'll give you seven dollars or for every dollar that thing goes down you give me seven dollars or something like that and but the main idea that these contracts have to be enforced and trusted them yes exactly you have to trust that they will work out in a system where nobody can be trusted yes this is such a beautiful complicated system okay so uh so you were seeking to kind of generalize this basic uh framework of contracts um so what does that entail so what what technically are the steps to creating ethereum sure so i guess just to kind of continue a bit with this master coin story um so started by kind of giving ideas for how to generalize the thing and eventually um this turned into a much more kind of fully fledged proposal that just says hey how about you scrap all your futures and instead you just um put in this programming language and i gave this idea to them and their response was something like hey this is great but this seems complicated and it seems like something that we're not going to be able to put onto our roadmap for a while and my response to this was like wait do you not realize how revolutionary this is well i'll just go do it myself and then i what was the name of the programming language i just called it ultimate scripting great uh so then i kind of went through a couple more rounds of iteration and then the idea for a theorem itself started to form um and the idea here is that you just have a blockchain where the core unit of the thing is what we call contracts it's these kind of accounts that can hold assets um and like they have their own internal memory but that are controlled by a piece of code and so if i send some ether to a contract the only thing that can determine where that kind of ether the currency inside ethereum and it goes after that um is the code of that contract itself and so basically kind of sending assets to computer programs becomes this kind of paradigm for creating these sort of agreements self executing agreements self executing it's so cool that code is sort of part of this contract so that that's what's meant by smart contracts yeah so how hard was it to build this kind of thing harder than expected um and originally i actually thought that this would be a thing that i would kind of casually work on for a couple of months publish and then go back to university um then i released it and a bunch of people or i released the white paper the white paper the idea is there the idea the white paper um a whole bunch of people came in offering the help a huge number of people and have expressed interest and this was something i was totally not expecting and then i kind of realized that this would be something that's kind of much bigger than i had ever um thought that it would be and then we started on this kind of much longer development slog of making something that lives up to this sort of much higher level of expectations what are the some of the is it fundamentally like software engineering challenges it was their social okay so there's social so so what are the biggest interesting challenges that you've learned about human civilization and in in software engineering through this process so i guess one of the challenges for me is that like i'm one of the kind of apparently unusual geek schoolers and i've never treated with anything but kindness in school yes um and so when i got into crypto i kind of expected everyone would just kind of be the same kind of altruistic and nice in that same way um but the um kind of the algorithm that i used for finding cofounders for this thing was not very good it was sort of literally one computer scientist called the greedy algorithm it's sort of the first 15 people who replied back offering to help kind of are the cofounders oh you mean like literally the the the people that for will form to be the the founders cofounders of the community the algorithm i like how you call it the algorithm yeah um and so what happened was that uh these um like especially as the project got really big like there started to be a lot of this kind of infighting and there were a lot of like i wanted the thing to be a non profit and some of them wanted to be a for profit uh and then there started to be people who were just kind of totally unable to work with each other there were people that were kind of trying to get an advantage for themselves in a lot of different ways and this uh just about six months later led to this big governance crisis and then we kind of reshuffled leadership a bit and then uh the project kept on going then nine months later there was another governance crisis and then there was a third governance crisis and so is there a way to if you're looking at the human side of things is there a way to optimize this aspect of the cryptocurrency world it seems that there is uh from my perspective there's a lot of different characters and personalities and egos and like you said uh i don't know if you know i also like to think that most of the world most of the people in the world are well intentioned but the way those intentions are realized may perhaps come off as uh yeah as as negative like what uh is there is there a hopeful message here about creating a governance structure for cryptocurrency that uh where everyone gets along and after about four rounds of reshuffle like i think we've actually come up with something that seems to be pretty stable and happy um i think uh i mean i definitely do think that most people are well intentioned i just think that like one of the reasons why i like decentralization is just because there's like this thing about power where power attracts people with egos and so that just allows us a very small percentage of people to just ruin so many things you think ego has a you think ego has a use like is ego always bad it seems like sometimes does but then the ethereum research team i feel like we've found also kind of a lot like a lot of very good people that are just kind of primarily just interested in things for the technology and uh things seem to just generally be going quite well yeah when you're when the focus and the passion is in the tech so on the so that's the human side of things but the technology side like what have you learned what have been the biggest challenges of bringing ethereum to life on the technology side so i think first of all just uh you know there's like the first law of software development which is that when someone gives you a timetable i switch the unit of time to the next largest unit of time and add one and like we basically fell victim to that um and uh and so instead of taking like three months it ended up taking like 20 months to watch the thing um and that was just i think underestimating the sheer technical complexity of the thing um there are research challenges like so for example one of the things that we've been saying from the start that we would do one is a switch from a proof of work to a proof of stake um where proof of stake is so this uh alternative consensus mechanism where instead of having to waste a lot of computing power on solving these mathematical puzzles that don't mean anything you kind of prove that you have access to coins inside of the system and this uh then it gives you some level of participation in the consensus can you maybe elaborate on that a little bit i understand the idea of proof of work um i know that a lot of people say that the idea of proof of stake is really appealing can you maybe linger on it longer explain what it is sure uh so basically the idea is like if i kind of lock up a hundred coins then i turn that into a kind of quote virtual miner and the system itself kind of automatically and randomly assigns that in a virtual miner the right to create blocks at particular intervals and then if someone else has 200 coins and they walk on the walk there's 200\nCluster 2:  Yeah\nCluster 3:  Or that same person could say that'll be longterm healthy for the platform or for the platform's influence on society outside of the platform, right? And it, you know, it's easy for me to sit here and say these things, but conceptually I do not think that these are kind of totally or should, they shouldn't be kind of completely alien ideas, right? That, you know, you could try things like this and it wouldn't be, you know, we wouldn't have to invent entirely new science to do it because if we're all already embedded in some metric space and there's a notion of distance between you and me and every other, every piece of content, then, you know, we know exactly, you know, the same model that tells, you know, dictates how to make me really happy also tells how to make me as unhappy as possible as well\nCluster 4:  And he said something about Diane and it wasn't good, but I didn't, he goes, why didn't you say something? I said, daddy, I just boy talk, you know? So, you know, and so he hugged me, he hugged me, he hugged me and, you know, it was one of these things that it's definitely made me a lot of who I am because there's been a lot of choices and I don't, I took the word choice out of my life and I just like to say, okay, do the right thing, do the thing that you should do\n","output_type":"stream"}],"execution_count":27},{"cell_type":"code","source":"import pandas as pd\nimport numpy as np\nfrom sklearn.metrics.pairwise import cosine_similarity\n\n\ndef obtener_embedding_busqueda(clave, modelo):\n    tokens = clave.split()\n    vectores = [modelo.wv[word] for word in tokens if word in modelo.wv]\n    if len(vectores) > 0:\n        return np.mean(vectores, axis=0)\n    else:\n        return np.zeros(modelo.vector_size)\n\n# FunciÃ³n para realizar la bÃºsqueda\ndef buscar_por_topico(clave, modelo, df_separaciones, top_n=5):\n    # Obtener el embedding de las palabras clave\n    embedding_busqueda = obtener_embedding_busqueda(clave, modelo)\n    \n    # Calcular la similitud coseno entre el embedding de bÃºsqueda y los embeddings de las oraciones\n    embeddings_oraciones = np.array(df_separaciones['embedding'].tolist())\n    similitudes = cosine_similarity([embedding_busqueda], embeddings_oraciones)[0]\n    \n    # Ordenar las oraciones por similitud\n    df_separaciones['similitud'] = similitudes\n    resultados = df_separaciones\n    \n    return resultados\n\n# Realizar la bÃºsqueda\nclave_busqueda = \"artificial intelligent\"\nresultados_busqueda = buscar_por_topico(clave_busqueda, model,df_separaciones)\n\n# Buscar los tÃ­tulos correspondientes a los ids encontrados en el CSV\ndef obtener_titulo_por_id(ids, csv_data):\n    # Filtrar el DataFrame del CSV para obtener solo las filas con los ids correspondientes\n    titulos = df[df['id'].isin(ids)][['id', 'title']]\n    return titulos\n\n# Obtener los ids de los resultados de bÃºsqueda\nids_resultados = resultados_busqueda['id'].tolist()\n\n# Obtener los tÃ­tulos correspondientes a esos ids\ntitulos_correspondientes = obtener_titulo_por_id(ids_resultados, df)\n\n# Mostrar los resultados de bÃºsqueda junto con los tÃ­tulos\nresultados_busqueda = resultados_busqueda.merge(titulos_correspondientes, on='id', how='left')\n\n# Mostrar los resultados\nprint(resultados_busqueda[['id', 'sentence', 'similitud', 'title']])\n","metadata":{"trusted":true,"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2025-01-14T14:54:41.915023Z","iopub.execute_input":"2025-01-14T14:54:41.915293Z","iopub.status.idle":"2025-01-14T14:54:42.553146Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2025-01-14T14:54:41.915274Z","shell.execute_reply":"2025-01-14T14:54:42.552255Z"}},"outputs":[{"name":"stdout","text":"         id                                           sentence  similitud  \\\n0         1  As part of MIT course 6S099, Artificial Genera...   0.426741   \n1         1                      He is a professor here at MIT  -0.053199   \n2         1   He's a physicist, spent a large part of his c...   0.213347   \n3         1   But he's also studied and delved into the ben...   0.478903   \n4         1   Amongst many other things, he is the cofounde...   0.301523   \n...     ...                                                ...        ...   \n391788  325                                 It's the beginning   0.119101   \n391789  325   It's not the whole story by any means, but it...   0.198845   \n391790  325   Where's state stored of the system?
